The benefits of using bubble sort on smaller subsets of the array can be that it produces
less overhead than Merge sort, as Merge has to create subArrays and merge them back together.
The downsides of bubblesort dissapear when the input is really small, and it becomes overall less memory intensive.
While it is not as generally efficient as merge sort, it is still a good option for smaller working sets.
